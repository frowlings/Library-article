	Photojournalism was the theme for one part of the final project of a digital photography class I recently took. I chose the library topic because I think libraries are doing a good job of staying relevant in the digital age while still offering a connection to the fundamental joys of having a good book to hold and read. The photojournalism aspect of the assignment was rewarding because, even though I thought I was aware of all the services the library offered, I learned a great deal more by asking the librarians questions.
